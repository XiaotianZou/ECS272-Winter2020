                This is a static picture.<br>
                The spots are used to represent the position where there is a corresponding burger place. Therefore, the desity of spots would also shows the number of restaurants in that area.<br> 
                As you can see in the picture, the creator listed the distribution of 23 different burger chains all over the US. The number above each map indicated the total number of this chain.<br>
                The distributon looks like population density of the US, which indicated the popularity of fast food in this country. The top 5 most welcomed chains are McDonald's, Burger King, <br>Wendy's, Diary Queen and Sonic.
                For the chains that are less popular, most of them have regional characteristics. In-N-Out, for example, most of its chains are located within California.<br> And for Steak'n Shake and Checkers Drive-In, you can clearly see that they almost 
                only exist in the east part of the states.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Overall, I think it is a good visualization, the position and distribution of each kind of chains are very clear and understadble. However, it would be much more difficult if users<br>
            have the need to compare the distributions between several different chains. So maybe the author could improve that by using differrent kinds of color and use them to mark the chains.</p>
